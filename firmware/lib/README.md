# Custom Libraries

This directory is for custom project-specific libraries.

Each library should be in its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
lib/
└── MyLibrary/
    ├── MyLibrary.h
    └── MyLibrary.cpp
```

## Example

For a temperature controller library:

```
lib/
└── TemperatureController/
    ├── TemperatureController.h
    └── TemperatureController.cpp
```
